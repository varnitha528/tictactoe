# tictactoe 
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe repository! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java. It demonstrates fundamental concepts such as arrays and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

# Overview
Tic-Tac-Toe is a game played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking a cell with their symbol ('X' or 'O'). The objective is to place three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal to win. If the grid is filled without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.

# Project Structure
TicTacToe.java: Contains the game board and methods to initialize, display, and manipulate the board. Also includes methods to check for win conditions and draws.
Player.java: Abstract class representing a player in the game.
HumanPlayer.java: A subclass of Player that allows a human player to make moves through user input.
AIPlayer.java: A subclass of Player that simulates an AI opponent making random moves.
LaunchGame.java: The main class that runs the game, initializing players and managing game flow.

# Example Usage
Start the game:
The human player (Bob) goes first, followed by the AI player (AI).
Make Moves:
Players take turns making moves.
Game End:
The game will announce the winner or declare a draw once a win condition is met or the board is full.


Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe!
